# my-julia-tools
fitting tools, useful functions and structures for HOQST, etc. 

First, it is necessary to install Julia and the following useful packages:

  IJulia.jl (to use Jupyter Notebook with Julia),
  Parameters.jl,
  LinearAlgebra.jl,
  OpenQuantumTools.jl,
  Markdown.jl,


ArbitraryHamiltonian.jl is useful for creating Transmon/Qubit/Resonator structures to quickly build hamiltonians for HOQST. 


TestOfFunctions.ipynb is an example test of functionality of ArbitraryHamiltonian.jl.
